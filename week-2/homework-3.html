        engineer named Alex. Every day, Alex embarked on a journey filled with
        coding adventures, bugs to conquer, and coffee to fuel the mind.</span

      [image of your choice about “Coder”] One fine morning, Alex sat down at
      the computer, ready to tackle the day's tasks. But alas! The code refused
      to compile, and the bugs seemed to multiply like rabbits in a magic hat.
      With a sigh, Alex dove deep into the code, armed with determination and a
      trusty stack overflow. [image of your choice about “Rabbit”] As lunchtime
      approached, Alex emerged from the coding abyss, victorious! The bugs were
      squashed, and the code ran smoother than a buttered-up slide. But just as
      Alex reached for the celebratory pizza, an urgent email arrived:
      "Emergency bug fix required! Code meltdown imminent!" With a heavy heart
      and a rumbling stomach, Alex returned to the battlefield. The hours ticked
      by, but so did the lines of code. With each keystroke, Alex grew stronger,
      wiser, and slightly more caffeinated. Finally, as the clock struck
      midnight, victory was declared! The bug was banished, the code was
      pristine, and Alex emerged from the coding cave, triumphant once more.
      With weary eyes and a satisfied grin, Alex closed the laptop and bid
      farewell to another day in the life of a software engineer.
